Multi Task:

process based

thread based


1. lightweight
2. communication b/t threads it is low.
3. thread will running in stack.
4. threads share the same address memory.


What is thread?
Thread is lightweight subprocess, it small unit of processing. it will execute separatly or 

Types of threads: 

1. user defined thread.
2. deamon thread 

Thread Life cycle:

new state   ---> Thread th = new Thread();
runnable state  --> th.start() --> run();
non runnable state -->th.sleep(1000). wait(). stop() --> 
destroyed state -->

How many ways to create thread?

1. By exteding Thread class -->
2. An implementing with Runnable interface --> run()
 
can we call run method direclty without start();

Syncronization:
1. Object level locking
2. Class Level locking

Syncronization is option where we wannt allow only one thread to be access the shared resource.

Uses: 
1. To prevent thread interference
2. To prevent Consistancy problem

They are 2 types: process syc, thread syc

Thread Syncronization:

1. Mutual Exclusive:
	1. Syncronized method
	2. Syncronized block
	3. staitc Syncronization: 

2. Co-operation (inter-thread communication): 
	wait(), notify, notifyAll
	
What is Polling? 
1. Object level locking
	lock is associated with Obect.
2. Class Level locking:
	lock is associated with Class.

Dead Lock Situation:
